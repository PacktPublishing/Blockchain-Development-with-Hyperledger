# Blockchain-Development-with-Hyperledger
Build decentralized applications with Hyperledger Fabric and Composer.

This Learning Path is your easy reference for exploring and building blockchain networks using Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, and Hyperledger Composer.  It begins with an overview of blockchain and shows you how to set up an Ethereum development environment for developing, packaging, building, and testing campaign-decentralized applications. You'll learn Solidity â€“ the de facto language for developing decentralized applications in Ethereum. You'll configure the Hyperledger Fabric and use these components to build private blockchain networks and applications that connect to them. Starting with the principles first, you'll learn to design and launch a network, implement smart contracts in chaincode, and much more.

By the end of this Learning Path, you'll be able to build and deploy your own decentralized applications by handling the key pain points encountered in the blockchain life cycle.


## What you will learn:
* Understand why decentralized applications are necessary
* Develop and test a decentralized application with Hyperledger Fabric and Hyperledger Composer
* Write and test a smart contract using Solidity
* Design transaction model and chaincode with Golang
* Deploy Composer REST Gateway to access the Composer transactions
* Maintain, monitor, and govern your blockchain solutions
