# Hyperledger Composer Sample Applications

The repository contains sample applications written against the [Hyperledger Composer](https://hyperledger.github.io/composer/)

Currently this contains the code and scripts for the ['DigitalProperty-App'](./packages/digitalproperty-app/README.md) tutorial - see the README in that directory for instructions on how to install.

To install this repo and find out more about the sample applications, run (from this directory):
```

npm install
node info.js

```


We welcome Pull Requests for new applications - please see the [contributing notes](https://github.com/hyperledger/composer/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

*IMPORTANT NOTE*  The Digital Property ("getting-started") sample CLI-based application is the main route for people to get started with Hyperledger Composer - please exercise care when changing it!
